AiLO-Adventure is powered by a **Dynamic Parkour System** that offers a wide variety of parkour moves inspired by beloved action-adventure games like *Assassin's Creed* and *Uncharted*. The game’s movement system is smooth and intuitive, allowing players to perform impressive parkour stunts effortlessly. Key gameplay features include:
